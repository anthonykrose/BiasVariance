      "A Markov Chain for this approach can be thought of as a graph with a node corresponding to each of the teams. The probability of transitioning between the node of team X and the node of team Y is related to the number of goals that Y scored against X. This can be thought of as each team 'voting' for how strong they consider each of the other teams in the league to be, where their votes are decided by the number of goals that they conceeded.
