      "Over the past two weeks or so we looked at alternative methods of ranking the Premier League according to results from the 2014-2015 season, using a [Markov Chain approach](http://biasvariance.blogspot.com/2015/07/premier-league-2014-15-season-rankings.html) and  an iterative approach to separately rank the [offensive and defensive capabillities of a team](http://biasvariance.blogspot.com/2015/07/blog-post.html). Today I'll look at a third technique: the [Elo rating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system) which is commonly used to rank chess players. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm not going to go through all of the technical details as they are well covered elsewhere, but basically the idea behind the Elo system is that each team/player's ability is a normally distributed variable, the mean of which changes slowly as time goes on. When two teams compete, the difference in their rating should help predict the outcome of the game, and both team's ratings are updated based on the outcome of every game played. If a lower rated team beats a highly rated team then they'll recieve a significant ratings boost, whereas if a highly rated team beats a weaker team then their score will be largely unaffected (given that they are expected to win these matches).\n",
      "\n",
      "What this means is that the rating should converge on a 'true' measure of the strength of the team: if their rating is too low then they should perform better than the system would predict and gain points until the rating settles at a more accurate measure of where they lie with respect to competitors."

I could have started with some initial ratings, perhaps taken from the league table of the 13/14 season, but to keep everything fair I'll begin with everyone equal at the start of the season:"
